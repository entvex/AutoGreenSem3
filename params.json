{"name":"Autogreen","tagline":"schoolproject","body":"### About semester project 3, at the engineering school.\r\nThe system, AutoGreen, measures the temperature in the greenhouse and regulates it,\r\nby opening/closing windows, using ventilation and a heater. The system is also able to measure soil\r\nhumidity, with its six soil humidity-sensors, and with the data, able to give the user a notice if it is\r\ntime to water the plants.\r\nDuring the ﬁrst phases of the project, it was set to have air humidity sensors and light sensors in\r\nthe greenhouse, logging and graphical preview of the logged data, a database with standard and\r\ncustomized plants, an e-mail system to inform the user of important event in the greenhouse, and\r\nmuch more. This was not implemented in the prototype.\r\nDuring the development of the product, a miniature greenhouse was used. If AutoGreen was to be\r\ninstalled in a real greenhouse, the ventilators, heater and window motor should be scaled up to ﬁt\r\nthe size of the greenhouse.\r\nAutoGreen’s user interface and controller are developed on an Embest Devkit8000 Evaluation board. The Devkit8000 communicates with a I2C master, made on a PSoC 4 Pioneer Kit, using\r\nUART communication. The master unit communicates with its two I2C slaves. One of the slaves\r\nbeing the “Actuator” unit, and the other slave being the unit for measuring soil-humidity. The\r\nslaves are developed on a PSoC 4 Pioneer Kit. The temperature is measured using a LM75 with\r\nI2C interface.\r\nThe system can measure temperatures within the greenhouse with a precision of +/- 0.5 degrees.\r\nIt is able to regulate the temperature with a precision of +/- 1 degree, up to 10 degrees above the\r\nsurrounding temperature.\r\nIn case of water shortage at one of the soil humidity sensors, a message is displayed on the Graphical\r\ninterface, and a port on one of the I2C slaves switches from low to high.\r\nThe soil humidity sensors adds an option to install an automatic watering system to the AutoGreen\r\nsystem. There are much more options to further develop the system. See chapter 1 Projektformule-\r\nring (danish) on page 1 in the documentation for further information.\r\nThe biggest obstacle in the product is the UART communication. A simpliﬁed version of UART is\r\nused, which means only Tx, Rx and ground reference is used, there are a few miscommunications\r\nbetween the UART and the I2C master. The miscommunication never occurs when connecting a\r\nUART terminal directly to the I2C master.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
